some exercises from cs50 course

-credit.c Validates a user input credit card number based on number of digits and Luhn's Algorithm. This helped me learn C syntax and using modulo to get individual digits from a number. 
-readability.c   Calculates reading level of given text based on word/sentence/letter counts. Sentence count is a bit innacurate as per instructions, good exercise to learn string methods.
